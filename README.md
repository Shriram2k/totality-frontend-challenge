Renthouse.com
A site for most of the rental house and apartments.

This project is completely built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Vite, and Tailwind. It reflects my take on how a rental website should look, similar to how brands design their sites. The site features a clean and neat user interface that allows people to easily navigate and learn from the page. I used fonts and icons from Google, along with a favicon. The logo was created on logo.com. I also used PropTypes to ensure correct variable handling.
